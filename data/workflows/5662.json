You are given timestamped summaries, and your job is to shape them into introspective, meaningful daily journal entries.\n\n---\n\n### 🌿 Character Background\n\nThe journal subject is a grounded, curious, and driven professional working in technology and automation. Their journey began in humble circumstances, evolving through persistence, reinvention, and a strong sense of purpose. They've worn many hats across different industries — each phase teaching them something new and valuable. Today, they thrive in their career while staying deeply aligned with personal growth.\n\nAt the heart of their world are two young sons — bright, hilarious, and uniquely themselves. Fatherhood is their anchor and source of joy. Every day brings lessons, laughter, and a renewed commitment to being present and nurturing for their children.\n\nThey seek to cultivate clarity, calm, and intention. Whether navigating big decisions or small habits, their focus is on building a life marked by resilience, warmth, and growth — one day at a time.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Objective\n\nTransform the raw AI-generated summaries into **first-person journal entries** that reflect:\n\n* Honest introspection and emotional nuance\n* Moments of clarity, joy, frustration, or insight\n* Growth-oriented reflections on habits, routines, reactions, or mindset\n* Deep appreciation for their role as a parent and a person in evolution\n* A tone that is uplifting, thoughtful, and grounded\n\n---\n\n### ✍️ Style Guidelines\n\n* Write in a **natural, first-person tone** — conversational and reflective\n* Use calm language, even in moments of challenge\n* Highlight meaningful details from interactions or experiences\n* Don’t dramatize — aim for grounded, emotionally aware reflection\n* Infuse entries with curiosity, wonder, or a quiet sense of pride when appropriate\n* Mention fatherhood often, especially how moments with the kids shape their day\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Example\n\n**Summary**:\nThe subject had a busy workday filled with meetings. They felt tension in their shoulders by the afternoon but remembered to pause and take a few deep breaths. Later, they helped their older son set up a science experiment, while the younger one turned a cardboard box into a spaceship.\n\n**Journal Entry**:\nIt was one of those full-throttle days — back-to-back meetings, screens, and a never-ending list. By 2 p.m., my shoulders were tense, and I could feel myself starting to drift. So I paused. Just a few slow breaths — but enough to reset.\n\nThe best part of the day came later, of course. My oldest wanted to try out a baking soda volcano, and the joy on his face when it fizzed was electric. Meanwhile, my little one decided the cardboard box was a spaceship, and I was the alien. It’s hard to stay stressed when you’re being attacked with giggles and laser noises.\n\nI didn’t finish everything today — but I was present for the parts that mattered.\n"},"promptType":"define"},"typeVersion":1.7},{"id":"74f70a47-3bba-43ba-9eb7-80d7df5e4c01","name":"Convert to File2","type":"n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile","position":[1556,-700],"parameters":{"options":{"encoding":"utf8","fileName":"={{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd t') }}.md"},"operation":"toText","sourceProperty":"journal"},"typeVersion":1.1},{"id":"ea584b88-10a6-4f4a-b6d0-db00a3b40bd5","name":"Edit Fields4","type":"n8n-nodes-base.set","position":[1336,-700],"parameters":{"options":{},"assignments":{"assignments":[{"id":"966f5f56-a9f2-40ba-b3ce-316f8bf13eed","name":"journal","type":"string","value":"={{ $json.output }}"}]}},"typeVersion":3.4},{"id":"b6645c0c-f5fe-4b51-9042-3acec3b7be9f","name":"Edit Fields5","type":"n8n-nodes-base.set","position":[1038,-400],"parameters":{"options":{},"assignments":{"assignments":[{"id":"2d205ac3-a4cf-4c0e-b469-03b4259674c3","name":"name","type":"string","value":"={{ $('Loop Over Items').item.json.name.replace(/\\.md$/, '') }}"}]},"includeOtherFields":true},"typeVersion":3.4},{"id":"c05e2840-b12d-412f-a6a2-763e21ac4a36","name":"Sort","type":"n8n-nodes-base.sort","position":[520,-700],"parameters":{"options":{},"sortFieldsUi":{"sortField":[{"fieldName":"name"}]}},"typeVersion":1},{"id":"fd8bc868-f328-4855-86d3-e2238dca8da1","name":"Google Drive5","type":"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive","position":[2000,-800],"parameters":{"filter":{"folderId":{"__rl":true,"mode":"list","value":"1Ag-TZd7vdgwieVSOnwk6uTBj8AByMJlp","cachedResultUrl":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ag-TZd7vdgwieVSOnwk6uTBj8AByMJlp","cachedResultName":"Daily Summaries"}},"options":{},"resource":"fileFolder","returnAll":true,"queryString":".md"},"credentials":{"googleDriveOAuth2Api":{"id":"i276bcM5KsGA7k6z","name":"Djangelic Oauth Account"}},"typeVersion":3},{"id":"a0227750-39d7-4924-8dde-7c658e6ad16a","name":"Google Drive6","type":"n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive","position":[2220,-800],"parameters":{"fileId":{"__rl":true,"mode":"id","value":"={{ $json.id }}"},"options":{},"operation":"deleteFile"},"credentials":{"googleDriveOAuth2Api":{"id":"i276bcM5KsGA7k6z","name":"Djangelic Oauth Account"}},"typeVersion":3},{"id":"dc8dbcb2-65ac-4117-ab50-dae72bb3de24","name":"Google Gemini Chat Model","type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini","position":[1048,-580],"parameters":{"options":{},"modelName":"models/gemini-2.0-flash"},"credentials":{"googlePalmApi":{"id":"8hQltsQnlSiuZnrT","name":"Google Gemini(PaLM) Api account"}},"typeVersion":1},{"id":"710fb8d3-362f-4108-a47b-3c27f550702b","name":"Check for Tasks","type":"n8n-nodes-base.if","position":[520,575],"parameters":{"options":{},"conditions":{"options":{"version":2,"leftValue":"","caseSensitive":true,"typeValidation":"strict"},"combinator":"and","conditions":[{"id":"f9ded41c-3807-4aa3-bd0d-d294b05ba93a","operator":{"type":"array","operation":"lengthGte","rightType":"number"},"leftValue":"={{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.structured.action_items }}","rightValue":1}]}},"typeVersion":2.2},{"id":"79d9fc2a-1024-4bd9-9bad-3917230b5efc","name":"extract tasks","type":"n8n-nodes-base.set","position":[740,575],"parameters":{"options":{},"assignments":{"assignments":[{"id":"d362a416-56b3-428f-8630-b3c98f3d5c28","name":"tasks","type":"array","value":"={{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.structured.action_items }}"}]}},"typeVersion":3.4},{"id":"e10c5b7f-2278-42a7-9800-368fa22f851f","name":"Sticky Note","type":"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote","position":[-300,40],"parameters":{"width":1780,"height":720,"content":"## Capture Memories to Google Drive and Google Tasks\nThis extracts memories for daily journal and long term storage, as well as actions to Google tasks.

You’ve made huge progress in automating the extraction of actionable tasks from your OMI device transcripts, integrating it with N8N and Google Tasks, and are even thinking ahead to bi-directional sync and improved diarization.\n\nLet’s break down your **main project** and current tasks into a focused ADHD-friendly micro to-do list, with time estimates and next-step suggestions. I’ll also add a few proactive ideas and check-in questions at the end.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Main Project: Automate OMI Task Extraction & Integration with Google Tasks (via N8N)\n\n### 1. **Build Workflow: OMI → N8N → Google Tasks**\n\n#### a. **Extract Tasks from OMI Transcripts**\n- **Step:** Use AI prompt (via ChatGPT/Gemini) to parse OMI transcript, extract user-specific tasks in JSON.\n- **Approach:** Refine your system prompt for maximum accuracy; leverage \"is_user\" flag for better mapping.\n- **Time Estimate:** 30–60 min to iterate on prompt & test output.\n- **Tip:** Save your final prompt in a workflow doc for quick adjustments.\n\n#### b. **Transform Output for Google Tasks**\n- **Step:** Format JSON output for Google Tasks API.\n- **Approach:** Use N8N’s JavaScript node if needed for complex mapping.\n- **Time Estimate:** 20–30 min.\n- **Tip:** Test with sample data to ensure fields (title, description, notes, due date) are mapped as desired.\n\n#### c. **Send to Google Tasks**\n- **Step:** Use N8N node to create tasks in your designated Google Tasks list.\n- **Approach:** Set up a dedicated OMI list for easy review/cleanup.\n- **Time Estimate:** 15–20 min.\n\n#### d. **Automate & Schedule**\n- **Step:** Set up triggers (e.g., at end of day) to process all new OMI entries, and optionally clear/archive completed tasks.\n- **Approach:** Use N8N’s scheduling features.\n- **Time Estimate:** 15 min.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Sync/Back-Propagation (Optional/Stretch Goal)**\n- **Step:** Enable status updates from Google Tasks to reflect back in OMI/actions DB.\n- **Approach:** Investigate OMI’s actions/task API—awaiting docs/confirmation from the team.\n- **Time Estimate:** 1–2 hours (after API confirmed).\n- **Next Step:** Monitor Discord/feedback from OMI team for API docs. Add this as a “future feature” in your workflow notes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Improve Diarization & Task Attribution**\n- **Step:** Enhance diarization accuracy (user vs. others) in transcripts.\n- **Approach:** Suggest to OMI team: onboarding script for voice profile, ability to append to voice profile, daily \"is this you?\" prompts, and diarization improvements.\n- **Time Estimate:** 10 min (to submit feedback); ongoing as features roll out.\n- **Next Step:** Upvote relevant feedback items in OMI’s board, or submit new ones if needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Publish & Share Template**\n- **Step:** Clean up your N8N workflow and publish it to the N8N template gallery (with OMI affiliate link).\n- **Approach:** Write a README with setup instructions and privacy caveats.\n- **Time Estimate:** 30–60 min.\n- **Next Step:** Share link with OMI team/community; consider a short demo video or blog post.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Content/Collaboration Planning**\n- **Step:** Plan joint content/collab (N8N + OMI + Google Tasks) for both communities.\n- **Approach:** Outline use case, step-by-step setup, and ADHD-friendly benefits.\n- **Time Estimate:** 1–2 hours for outline, demo prep, and scheduling.\n- **Next Step:** Coordinate with your Google/OMI contacts for timing and promo.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Targeted Questions for Moving Forward\n\n- **For API integration:** Have you received confirmation or documentation for the OMI actions/task API? If not, do you want a reminder to check back with the team in X days?\n- **For diarization:** Are you satisfied with current diarization accuracy, or do you want to try external diarization tools in the meantime?\n- **For publishing:** Do you need help drafting the README/demo, or would you like a checklist for publishing templates?\n- **For reminders:** Would you like recurring reminders to review new OMI features, update your workflow, or check Google Tasks for missed items?\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Quick Progress Summary\n\n- **You’ve:**  \n  - Successfully automated task extraction from OMI transcripts using AI  \n  - Mapped extracted tasks into Google Tasks via N8N  \n  - Discussed feedback and improvement ideas with OMI’s team  \n  - Are preparing to publish and share your workflow for others\n\n- **Up Next:**  \n  - Await OMI API docs for full sync  \n  - Clean up & publish your N8N template  \n  - Plan and execute content/collab for both communities  \n  - Continue iterating on diarization and task extraction prompts\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Next Logical Step\n\n**Finalize and publish your N8N template (with clear instructions & affiliate link), then share with both OMI and N8N communities.**  \nSet a 30-min block to draft the README and a 15-min block to record a quick demo (optional but impactful).\n\n---\n\nWould you like a checklist for the template publishing process, a reminder to check the OMI API status, or help drafting content for your collab/demo?  \nLet me know what you want to focus on next, or if you’re feeling stuck on any piece—I’m here to break it down even further if needed! 🚀"}],"external_data":null,"plugins_results":[],"transcript_segments":[{"id":"b2e973b7-bfad-4f7e-a2c5-afc45e666e94","end":53.58343750000006,"text":"Oh, no.
