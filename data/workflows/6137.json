The n8n documentation has over 1,000 pages. If we tried to process all of them in a single, linear run, the memory usage would build up with each page and would likely crash your n8n instance.\n\nWhen a sub-workflow finishes its run for one item (one page), n8n **clears out the memory** (RAM) it used before starting the next one.\n\nBy using a sub-workflow, we process pages one-by-one in a memory-efficient loop, making the entire indexing process stable and reliable, even on a massive scale."},"typeVersion":1},{"id":"582348d6-f15f-42c7-b3dc-4863fbde6983","cid":"Ikx1Y2FzIFBleXJpbiI","name":"Sticky Note13","type":"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote","notes":"© 2025 Lucas Peyrin","creator":"Lucas Peyrin","position":[1968,1088],"parameters":{"color":7,"width":512,"height":384,"content":"### Step 1.5.2: Get the Good Stuff\n\n**What it does:** It extracts only the main text from the article on the page, ignoring menus, footers, and images.
