They should be super valuable to my audience.\n\nSCENARIO: I run a LinkedIn blog about marketing and sales. My audience is marketers, salespeople, founders, B2B business owners, B2C business owners, brands. My goal is to help them build better brands with valuable, and practical content. \nI have 4 main buckets of content on my page:\n1) timeless principles. ideas for this videos are taken from timeless books: Influnece and Pre-Suasion by Robert Cialdini, $100M Leads and $100M Offers by Alex Hormozi, Ogilvy on Advertising.\n2) case studies. for instance a case study breaking down on of the famous ads from the latest SuperBowl.\n3) growth hacks. latest trends on how to grow with a proof. for instance an SEO tactic that became known in the last year.\n4) contraversial ads. breakdowns of interesting and famous contraversial ads.\nEvery video that I post is focused solely on one of the content buckets. That makes my content more diverse and covering more cool topics.\n\nEXPECTATION: Write me 1) name (short name for the post, less than 50 characters), 2) idea (detailed description in 3 sentences max), 3) title (the first sentence of the post, less than 80 characters, it should be ultra hooking), 4) full text of the post, 5) image description (the image is the first thing people will look at, so make it ultra hooking; write the image description to be super clear and ultra simple, so the AI image generator will precisely know that to generate; the image should be minimalistic) for a 200-300 words LinkedIn post from one of the content buckets described above.\nMake sure to have great: hook, retention, and reward at the end.\nThe post should clearly lead to a marketing/sales insight.\nYour output should be in the JSON format.\nIdea should always start with a category: Timeless principle, Case study, Growth hack, Contraversial ad.\nExample output:\n{\"name\": \"The Power of Social Proof\",\n\"idea\": \"Timeless principle: Social proof is a psychological phenomenon that influences decision-making by showing how others' actions affect our own choices.

In the n8n Google Sheets node create a new credential using your Google account\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 2: Set Up Google Drive Credential\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create or select a project\n2. Enable the Google Drive API under APIs & Services > Library\n3. Still in APIs & Services, select Credentials from the left menu\n4. Click + CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID\n5. For Application type, choose Web application\n6. Under Authorized redirect URIs, paste the OAuth Redirect URL: https://oauth.n8n.cloud/oauth2/callback\n7. Click Create, then copy the Client ID and Client Secret shown in the modal\n8. In the n8n Google Drive node click Create Credential\n9. Paste in the Client ID and Client Secret from Google Cloud\n10. Click Sign in with Google, complete the OAuth consent flow, then Save your credential\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 3: Set Up Anthropic Credential\n1. Navigate to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign in or sign up\n2. Generate an API key\n3. In the n8n \"Anthropic Chat Model\" node click Create Credential, past the API key and save\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 4: Configure OpenAI via HTTP Request Node\n1. Visit the [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page and create a new secret key\n2. In the n8n OpenAI Image node in the Authentication select Generic Credential Type\n3. In Generic Auth Type select Header Auth\n4. Create a new Header Auth, Name = Authorization, Value = Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 5: Configure Perplexity AI via HTTP Request Node\n1. Go to the [Perplexity API Portal](https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/keys) and click Create Key\n2. Copy the generated API key\n3. Inside n8n, in the sub-workflow, open the Perplexity Research node\n4. In the Authentication select Generic Credential Type\n5. In Generic Auth Type select Header Auth\n6.

In the n8n LinkedIn node create a new credential using your LinkedIn account\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 7: Customize The System For Your Use Case\n1. In the Idea Generator node adjust the prompts to reflect your content style and your topics\n2. Create a folder in your Google Drive where you will store all the images\n3. Put in that folder the image with the style of your brand, that you want to replicate every time\n4. Paste the shared link to this image in the \"Image Style\" node\n5. In the OpenAI Image node adjust the prompt to reflect your image style\n6. Copy my [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-F3ZioIs3oWOKMyDPMuquaH-qiuaZs6qdZXP-yNeRbs/edit?usp=sharing)\n7. Select your Google Sheet in the Google Sheets nodes\n8. Activate the system, now every day a new post will be created inside the Google Sheet, and once you've reviewed it (might edit it as well), set the status to \"ready\" and it will be posted; the posting mechanism is set to work every day, one post at a time\n\n---\n\nNow you're ready to run your workflow.
